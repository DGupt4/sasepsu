Hello to future Marketing Directors! This is Jude Bislig and I created this website :) Here are some instructions you may need to update things in case you don't have much web development experience! And don't worry, you'll learn on the job.

HOME PAGE (index.html)
 - Leadership Board [line ~103]: Change the names and point labels when the leaderboard changes
 - Events Showcase [line ~130]: Replace the old event image file in the images/home-page folder with the new event image. Replace the h4 text underneath
 - Sponsor section [line ~185]: Currently there are four divs (class="carousel-item") which contain the four current sponsors. Just change the image src to the new sponsor and put the sponsor image in images/sponsors. If there are more or less than 4 sponsors then copy paste or delete the divs
 - QR Code [line ~255]: If there is a new qr code for the upcoming school year newsletter signup, replace the image src

EXECUTIVE BOARD PAGE (eboard.html)
 - Exec board cards [line ~55]: This whole page will change aside from the adviser when there is a new eboard. In this page there are divs (class = "team-card") which hold the info for each member. Simple change the image src and replace the image in images/eboard, change the h3 to the new name, and the <p> tag with the new major and year. Also change the <a> with the new email (and also change the mailto: with the new email as well). Also replace the links for the icons for email, linkedin, and instagram with the new links.

GALLERY PAGE (gallery.html)
 - Change the image links to the new images. Change text to match events (title and date)
 - MAKE SURE IMAGES ARE SQUARE (Equal width and height) to ensure they fit in the container divs.
 - Hero [line ~45] Also change the year to the current year.
 - Update the link to the photocircle

FAQ PAGE (faq.html)
 - This should not change. If it needs to, just update the text/questions to what you need.

CONFERENCE PAGE (conference.html)
 - Hero [line ~44]: change the year, date, and location
 - Conference status [line ~50]: There are two status divs - one where conference applications are live and one where they are closed. Currently one of the statuses is commented out (not active). When conference applications are up, uncomment the active div and comment out the "closed" div. Also update the <a> tag with the new conference application form.
 - YouTube video [line ~183]: Replace the link with the new embedded YouTube video link. Look up a tutorial to obtain an embedded link from a YouTube video.
 - Conference pictures [line ~253]: change the image src for each image with new images from the most recent conference. Make a new folder in images (images/conference-20XX where 20XX is the current year) and put any new images in that new folder. Do what you want with the old folder (delete or keep)

UPCOMING EVENTS (events.html)
 - Calendar [line ~51]: Only change the calendar link but keep the same class=calendar. Look online how to embed a Google calendar with html if the calendar needs to be changed to a different one.

SASE COMMONWEALTH CONNECT
 - Contacts [line ~54]: Change images and information for each person for the new year!

And you are done! Good luck for the year :) If anything else on the website needs to be changed you can also do so, but these are just the essential things I think would need to be updated with each new school year.
